# Analysis-of-brands-bought

This dataset presents data from the accumulation of purchases made by individuals, who bought various fashion items ranging from jeans, sweaters, and so on. These items were purchased from different brands and it also shows the prices they were purchased for. In my analysis, I had to do more visualization than cleaning (not much cleaning to be done) as I wanted to find out the more common brand people like to buy from (Adidas, Nike and so on), the most common colour of fashion items people prefer and the most common item bought such as sweaters, jeans, shoes amongst others. 
A pivot table was created to better visualize this data, and a column chart was also created, into which a slicer was inserted so that the data can be easily sorted by brands, colors, and fashion items (product name).
The pivot table can be further broken down to also see these various breakdown.

This dataset was gotten from Kaggle, and this is the link to it: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/fashion-products
